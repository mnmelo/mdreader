This example simply iterates through a trajectory, doing nothing.
The fm Timestep object contain several trajectory-related attributes
(see the MDAnalysis documentation).
Access to coordinates can be achieved by defining an AtomGroup selection
before iteration, which will then have its coordinates updated at each cycle.
